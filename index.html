        <h3>Jason Best - Portfolio</h3>

<p>These pages highlight my work and study in biodiversity informatics, digital curation, data management, and digital repositories.</p>

Typeface Corpus - https://github.com/jbest/typeface-corpus
The repository is initially focused on compiling data that is relevant to the OCR activities conducted in the natural history collections communities and in the digital humanities communities. These communities face the challenge of needing to extract high-quality text from documents and images that contain a variety of typefaces. The goal of this repository is to compile a corpus of typeface samples in standardized formats to help the natural history collection and digital humanities communities significantly improve the quality of text generated by OCR engines such as Tesseract and OCRopus.

Darwin Score - https://github.com/jbest/darwin-score
A method to evaluate text representing a natural history bio-collection object. Scores calculated in this process can help provide a rough evaluation of the quality of the text, whether it be generated by human transcription or OCR. Initially, this will focus on labels and annotations applied to herbarium collections. This process will check the text for words including taxonomic names, collector names, annotator names, location names, common abbreviations and other expected words (all stored in purpose-built dictionaries) and patterns such as dates, numbers, and geocoordinates. The text is given a score based on the number of the matches found.

Regex Repository - https://github.com/jbest/regex-repo
A regular expression repository for natural history collection data. The goal of this project is to create a repository of regular expressions that are focused on parsing strings commonly found in records of natural history collections. There are many regex repositories avaiable on the web but this repository will not only focus on the most relevant expressions, but will also include documentation and tests to verify each regular expression.

Apiary Project - http://www.apiaryproject.org
HThe University of North Texas’ Texas Center for Digital Knowledge (TxCDK) and the Botanical Research Institute of Texas (BRIT) are conducting fundamental research with the goal of identifying how human intelligence can be combined with machine processes for effective and efficient transformation of textual museum specimen label information into high-quality machine-processible parsed data. This project is advancing understanding of the workflow and processes best able to increase access to digitized biological collection metadata within the stakeholder communities comprised of biologists, natural history museum collections managers, biodiversity standards groups, and the library and information science community. A key challenge faced by all natural history collections is determining a transformation process that yields high-quality results in a cost- and time-efficient manner. The results of this research will yield a new workflow model for effective and efficient label data transformation, correction, and enhancement that can be replicated, adapted, and transferred to herbaria and other natural history collections.

Atrium Biodiversity Information System - http://www.atrium-biodiversity.org
Atrium® is a biodiversity information system developed by the Botanical Research Institute of Texas (BRIT). The vast amounts of data generated through biodiversity research can pose a unique challenge and opportunity for institutions whose researchers must collaborate over great distances. Atrium is designed to increase the speed and extend the capabilities of biodiversity research by facilitating the processes of:

Sharing – Atrium provides instant, global access to a wealth of botanical and ecological data.
Collaboration – Atrium provides researchers with tools to collaborate worldwide in real-time using web technology and purpose-built tools to streamline the research process.
Publication – Atrium streamlines the publication of field guides and flora in digital and printed formats.
